1.    The openssl-fips-ecp-2.0.2.tar.gz file distribution file which was used as the basis for the production of the FIPS 
        object module was obtained from  the  FIPS compatible OpenSSL library from physical media (CD) 
        obtained directly from the OpenSSL foundation.
2.    The host platform on which the fipscanister.o, fipscanister.o.sha1,fips_premain.c, 
        and fips_premain.c.sha1 files were generated is OX-X. The compiler used was gcc version 4.6.
3.    The fipscanister.o module was generated with exactly the three commands:
            ./config
            make                      
            make install
        No other build-time options were specified.
4.    The HMAC SHA-1 digest of the produced fipscanister.o is: 
        HMAC-SHA1(fipscanister.o)= f129aeb6f91736bde36e8b0d4c11a15bd454d2d1
5.    The contents of the distribution file used to create 
        fipscanister.o was not manually modified in any way at any time during the build process.
