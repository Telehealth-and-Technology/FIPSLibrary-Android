Instructions for end application users of the FCADS libraries.
=============================================================

1. Copy files to your development directory
	dev/android-database-sqlcipher/libs


2. In the initialization of your app, call FIPSFromJNI(), confirm return value is 1
	This sets FIPS mode, initializes FIPS and runs self tests
      Ex:
	int result = FIPSFromJNI();	
	if (j == 1) {
		Log.i("mytag", "PASSED - successfully enabled FIPS!" );

	}
3. User sqlcipher database just as you would sqlite
	See: http://sqlcipher.net/sqlcipher-for-android
	
4. When application is complete, create the following FIPS documentation files from templates:
	doc/FIPS140-2ApplicationComplianceStatementTemplate.txt
	doc/FIPS140-2ApplicationComplianceRecordTemplate.txt
