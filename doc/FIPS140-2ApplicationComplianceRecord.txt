To be completed by applicatioin developer:

1.	A record of the HMAC SHA-1 digest of the fipscanister.o that was embedded in the application.
2.	An assertion that the application does not utilize any cryptographic implementations other that those provided by the FIPS Object Module or contained in the FIPS capable OpenSSL 1.0.1 libraries (where non-FIPS algorithms are disabled in FIPS mode).
3.	A description of how the application clearly indicates when FIPS mode is enabled
(assuming that FIPS mode is a runtime selectable option). Note that the application must call FIPS_mode_set(), whether that call is triggered by runtime options or not.
