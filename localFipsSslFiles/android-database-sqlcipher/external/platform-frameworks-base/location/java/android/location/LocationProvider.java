 * for example, some providers require GPS hardware and visibility to
 * a number of satellites; others require the use of the cellular
 * radio, or access to a specific carrier's network, or to the
 * internet.  They may also have different battery consumption
 * characteristics or monetary costs to the user.  The {@link
