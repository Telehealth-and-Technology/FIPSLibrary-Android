  <dt><a href="{@docRoot}resources/articles/can-i-use-this-intent.html">Can I Use this Intent?</a></dt>
  <dd>Android offers a very powerful and yet easy-to-use message type called an intent. You can use intents to turn applications into high-level libraries and make code modular and reusable. While it is nice to be able to make use of a loosely coupled API, there is no guarantee that the intent you send will be received by another application. This article describes a technique you can use to find out whether the system contains any application capable of responding to the intent you want to use.</dd>
