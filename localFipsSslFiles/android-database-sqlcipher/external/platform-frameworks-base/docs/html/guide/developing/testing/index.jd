    Android includes powerful tools for setting up and running test applications.
    Whether you are working in Eclipse with ADT or working from the command line, these tools
    help you set up and run your tests within an emulator or the device you are targeting.
    The documents listed below explain how to work with the tools in your development environment.

    If you aren't yet familiar with the Android testing framework, please read the topic
    <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/testing/testing_android.html">Testing Fundamentals</a>
    before you get started.
    For a step-by-step introduction to Android testing, try the <a
    href="{@docRoot}resources/tutorials/testing/helloandroid_test.html">Hello, Testing</a>
    tutorial, which introduces basic testing concepts and procedures.
    For a more advanced tutorial, try <a

    which guides you through a more complex testing scenario.

            The ADT plugin lets you quickly set up and manage test projects directly in
            the Eclipse UI. Once you have written your tests, you can build and run them and
            then see the results in the Eclipse JUnit view. You can also use the SDK command-line
            tools to execute your tests if needed.

        The SDK command-line tools provide the same capabilities as the ADT plugin. You can
        use them to set up and manage test projects, build your test application,
        run your tests, and see the results. You use
        the <code>android</code> tool to create and manage test projects, the Ant build system
        to compile them, and the <code>adb</code> tool to install and run them.
