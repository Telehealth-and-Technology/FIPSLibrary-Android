Items requiring attention:

(hi) Add gc card marking to aput/iput/sput/new_filled_array
(hi) Correct stack overflow handling (dvmCleanupStackOverflow takes an
     additional argument now)
(hi) "debugger active" test in common_periodicChecks must handle
     the case where glue->pDebuggerActive is a NULL pointer (used to
     skip a memory load when debugger support is completely disabled)
(hi) WITH_DEBUGGER and WITH_PROFILER are no longer defined (but are
     assumed to be enabled)

(md) Correct OP_MONITOR_EXIT (need to adjust PC before throw)
(md) OP_THROW needs to export the PC

(lo) Implement OP_BREAKPOINT
(lo) Implement OP_EXECUTE_INLINE_RANGE
(lo) Implement OP_*_VOLATILE (12 instructions)
