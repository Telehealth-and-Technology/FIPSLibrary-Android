Notes on Threading

All threads are native pthreads.  All threads, except the JDWP debugger
thread, are visible to code running in the VM and to the debugger.  (We
don't want the debugger to try to manipulate the thread that listens for
instructions from the debugger.)  Internal VM threads are in the "system"
ThreadGroup, all others are in the "main" ThreadGroup, per convention.

The GC only runs when all threads have been suspended.  Threads are
expected to suspend themselves, using a "safe point" mechanism.  We check
for a suspend request at certain points in the main interpreter loop,
and on requests coming in from native code (e.g. all JNI functions).
Certain debugger events may inspire threads to self-suspend.

Native methods must use JNI calls to modify object references to avoid
clashes with the GC.  JNI doesn't provide a way for native code to access
arrays of objects as such -- code must always get/set individual entries --
so it should be possible to fully control access through JNI.

Internal native VM threads, such as the finalizer thread, must explicitly
check for suspension periodically.  In most cases they will be sound
asleep on a condition variable, and won't notice the suspension anyway.

Threads may be suspended by the GC, debugger, or the SIGQUIT listener
thread.  The debugger may suspend or resume individual threads, while the
GC always suspends all threads.  Each thread has a "suspend count" that
is incremented on suspend requests and decremented on resume requests.
When the count is zero, the thread is runnable.  This allows us to fulfill
a debugger requirement: if the debugger suspends a thread, the thread is
not allowed to run again until the debugger resumes it (or disconnects,
in which case we must resume all debugger-suspended threads).

Paused threads sleep on a condition variable, and are awoken en masse.
Certain "slow" VM operations, such as starting up a new thread, will be
done in a separate "VMWAIT" state, so that the rest of the VM doesn't
freeze up waiting for the operation to finish.  Threads must check for
pending suspension when leaving VMWAIT.

Because threads suspend themselves while interpreting code or when native
code makes JNI calls, there is no risk of suspending while holding internal
VM locks.  All threads can enter a suspended (or native-code-only) state.
Also, we don't have to worry about object references existing solely
in hardware registers.

We do, however, have to worry about objects that were allocated internally
and aren't yet visible to anything else in the VM.  If we allocate an
object, and then go to sleep on a mutex after changing to a non-RUNNING
state (e.g. while trying to allocate a second object), the first object
could be garbage-collected out from under us while we sleep.  To manage
this, we automatically add all allocated objects to an internal object
tracking list, and only remove them when we know we won't be suspended
before the object appears in the GC root set.

The debugger may choose to suspend or resume a single thread, which can
lead to application-level deadlocks; this is expected behavior.  The VM
will only check for suspension of single threads when the debugger is
active (the java.lang.Thread calls for this are deprecated and hence are
not supported).  Resumption of a single thread is handled by decrementing
the thread's suspend count and sending a broadcast signal to the condition
variable.  (This will cause all threads to wake up and immediately go back
to sleep, which isn't tremendously efficient, but neither is having the
debugger attached.)

The debugger is not allowed to resume threads suspended by the GC.  This
is trivially enforced by ignoring debugger requests while the GC is running
(the JDWP thread is suspended during GC).

The VM maintains a Thread struct for every pthread known to the VM.  There
is a java/lang/Thread object associated with every Thread.  At present,
there is no safe way to go from a Thread object to a Thread struct except by
locking and scanning the list; this is necessary because the lifetimes of
the two are not closely coupled.  We may want to change this behavior,
though at present the only performance impact is on the debugger (see
threadObjToThread()).  See also notes about dvmDetachCurrentThread().
*/
/*
Alternate implementation (signal-based):

Threads run without safe points -- zero overhead.  The VM uses a signal
(e.g. pthread_kill(SIGUSR1)) to notify threads of suspension or resumption.

The trouble with using signals to suspend threads is that it means a thread
can be in the middle of an operation when garbage collection starts.
To prevent some sticky situations, we have to introduce critical sections
to the VM code.

Critical sections temporarily block suspension for a given thread.
The thread must move to a non-blocked state (and self-suspend) after
finishing its current task.  If the thread blocks on a resource held
by a suspended thread, we're hosed.

One approach is to require that no blocking operations, notably
acquisition of mutexes, can be performed within a critical section.
This is too limiting.  For example, if thread A gets suspended while
holding the thread list lock, it will prevent the GC or debugger from
being able to safely access the thread list.  We need to wrap the critical
section around the entire operation (enter critical, get lock, do stuff,
release lock, exit critical).

A better approach is to declare that certain resources can only be held
within critical sections.  A thread that enters a critical section and
then gets blocked on the thread list lock knows that the thread it is
waiting for is also in a critical section, and will release the lock
before suspending itself.  Eventually all threads will complete their
operations and self-suspend.  For this to work, the VM must:

 (1) Determine the set of resources that may be accessed from the GC or
     debugger threads.  The mutexes guarding those go into the "critical
     resource set" (CRS).
 (2) Ensure that no resource in the CRS can be acquired outside of a
     critical section.  This can be verified with an assert().
 (3) Ensure that only resources in the CRS can be held while in a critical
     section.  This is harder to enforce.

If any of these conditions are not met, deadlock can ensue when grabbing
resources in the GC or debugger (#1) or waiting for threads to suspend
(#2,#3).  (You won't actually deadlock in the GC, because if the semantics
above are followed you don't need to lock anything in the GC.  The risk is
rather that the GC will access data structures in an intermediate state.)

This approach requires more care and awareness in the VM than
safe-pointing.  Because the GC and debugger are fairly intrusive, there
really aren't any internal VM resources that aren't shared.  Thus, the
enter/exit critical calls can be added to internal mutex wrappers, which
makes it easy to get #1 and #2 right.

An ordering should be established for all locks to avoid deadlocks.

Monitor locks, which are also implemented with pthread calls, should not
cause any problems here.  Threads fighting over such locks will not be in
critical sections and can be suspended freely.

This can get tricky if we ever need exclusive access to VM and non-VM
resources at the same time.  It's not clear if this is a real concern.

There are (at least) two ways to handle the incoming signals:

 (a) Always accept signals.  If we're in a critical section, the signal
     handler just returns without doing anything (the "suspend level"
     should have been incremented before the signal was sent).  Otherwise,
     if the "suspend level" is nonzero, we go to sleep.
 (b) Block signals in critical sections.  This ensures that we can't be
     interrupted in a critical section, but requires pthread_sigmask()
     calls on entry and exit.

This is a choice between blocking the message and blocking the messenger.
Because UNIX signals are unreliable (you can only know that you have been
signaled, not whether you were signaled once or 10 times), the choice is
not significant for correctness.  The choice depends on the efficiency
of pthread_sigmask() and the desire to actually block signals.  Either way,
it is best to ensure that there is only one indication of "blocked";
having two (i.e. block signals and set a flag, then only send a signal
if the flag isn't set) can lead to race conditions.

The signal handler must take care to copy registers onto the stack (via
setjmp), so that stack scans find all references.  Because we have to scan
native stacks, "exact" GC is not possible with this approach.

Some other concerns with flinging signals around:
 - Odd interactions with some debuggers (e.g. gdb on the Mac)
 - Restrictions on some standard library calls during GC (e.g. don't
   use printf on stdout to print GC debug messages)

     * thread could try to do operations on the new thread before it had
     * finished starting.
     *
     * The new thread will lock the thread list, change its state to
     * THREAD_STARTING, broadcast to gDvm.threadStartCond, and then sleep
     * on gDvm.threadStartCond (which uses the thread list lock).  This
     * thread (the parent) will either see that the thread is already ready
     * after we grab the thread list lock, or will be awakened from the
     * condition variable on the broadcast.
     *
     * We don't want to stall the rest of the VM while the new thread
     * starts, which can happen if the GC wakes up at the wrong moment.
     * So, we change our own status to VMWAIT, and self-suspend if
     * necessary after we finish adding the new thread.
     *
     *
     * We have to deal with an odd race with the GC/debugger suspension
     * mechanism when creating a new thread.  The information about whether
     * or not a thread should be suspended is contained entirely within
     * the Thread struct; this is usually cleaner to deal with than having
     * one or more globally-visible suspension flags.  The trouble is that
     * we could create the thread while the VM is trying to suspend all
     * threads.  The suspend-count won't be nonzero for the new thread,
     * so dvmChangeStatus(THREAD_RUNNING) won't cause a suspension.
     *
     * The easiest way to deal with this is to prevent the new thread from
     * running until the parent says it's okay.  This results in the
     * following (correct) sequence of events for a "badly timed" GC
     * (where '-' is us, 'o' is the child, and '+' is some other thread):
     *
     *  - call pthread_create()
     *  - lock thread list
     *  - put self into THREAD_VMWAIT so GC doesn't wait for us
     *  - sleep on condition var (mutex = thread list lock) until child starts
     *  + GC triggered by another thread
     *  + thread list locked; suspend counts updated; thread list unlocked
     *  + loop waiting for all runnable threads to suspend
     *  + success, start GC
     *  o child thread wakes, signals condition var to wake parent
     *  o child waits for parent ack on condition variable
     *  - we wake up, locking thread list
     *  - add child to thread list
     *  - unlock thread list
     *  - change our state back to THREAD_RUNNING; GC causes us to suspend
     *  + GC finishes; all threads in thread list are resumed
     *  - lock thread list
     *  - set child to THREAD_VMWAIT, and signal it to start
     *  - unlock thread list
     *  o child resumes
     *  o child changes state to THREAD_RUNNING
     *
     * The above shows the GC starting up during thread creation, but if
     * it starts anywhere after VMThread.create() is called it will
     * produce the same series of events.
     *
     * Once the child is in the thread list, it will be suspended and
     * resumed like any other thread.  In the above scenario the resume-all
     * code will try to resume the new thread, which was never actually
     * suspended, and try to decrement the child's thread suspend count to -1.
     * We can catch this in the resume-all code.
     *
     * Bouncing back and forth between threads like this adds a small amount
     * of scheduler overhead to thread startup.
     *
     * One alternative to having the child wait for the parent would be
     * to have the child inherit the parents' suspension count.  This
     * would work for a GC, since we can safely assume that the parent
     * thread didn't cause it, but we must only do so if the parent suspension
     * was caused by a suspend-all.  If the parent was being asked to
     * suspend singly by the debugger, the child should not inherit the value.
     *
     * We could also have a global "new thread suspend count" that gets
     * picked up by new threads before changing state to THREAD_RUNNING.
     * This would be protected by the thread list lock and set by a
     * suspend-all.

     * lock, it times out after 3 seconds.  If at some point the thread
     * is told to suspend, the clock resets; but since the VM is still
     * theoretically mid-resume, there's no suspend pending.  If, for

     *
     * We now perform the unlock before the wakeup broadcast.  The next
     * suspend can't actually start until the broadcast completes and
     * returns, because we're holding the thread-suspend-count lock, but the
     * suspending thread is now able to make progress and we avoid the abort.
     *
     * (Technically there is a narrow window between when we release
     * the thread-suspend lock and grab the thread-suspend-count lock.
     * This could cause us to send a broadcast to threads with nonzero
     * suspend counts, but this is expected and they'll all just fall
     * right back to sleep.  It's probably safe to grab the suspend-count

         * be performing a GC now.

         *                                  check suspend count (== 0)
         *   dvmSuspendAllThreads()
         *   grab suspend-count lock

         *   release suspend-count lock

         *   all are suspended, begin GC
         *                                  set state to RUNNING
         *                                  (continue executing)
         *
         * We can correct this by grabbing the suspend-count lock and
         * performing both of our operations (check suspend count, set
         * state) while holding it, now we need to grab a mutex on every
         * transition to RUNNING.
         *
         * What we do instead is change the order of operations so that
         * the transition to RUNNING happens first.  If we then detect
         * that the suspend count is nonzero, we switch to SUSPENDED.
         *
         * Appropriate compiler and memory barriers are required to ensure
         * that the operations are observed in the expected order.
         *
         * This does create a small window of opportunity where a GC in
         * progress could observe what appears to be a running thread (if
         * it happens to look between when we set to RUNNING and when we
         * switch to SUSPENDED).  At worst this only affects assertions
         * and thread logging.  (We could work around it with some sort
         * of intermediate "pre-running" state that is generally treated
         * as equivalent to running, but that doesn't seem worthwhile.)
         *
         * We can also solve this by combining the "status" and "suspend
         * count" fields into a single 32-bit value.  This trades the
         * store/load barrier on transition to RUNNING for an atomic RMW
         * op on all transitions and all suspend count updates (also, all
         * accesses to status or the thread count require bit-fiddling).
         * It also eliminates the brief transition through RUNNING when
         * the thread is supposed to be suspended.  This is possibly faster
