Using the FCADS Android FIPS compliant library in an android project:
=====================================================================

1. Retrieve libraries and assets from release folder:
	In the release directory structure the library files are at:
		./object/android/libs
		./object/android/assets

	In the full build source code directory structure the library files are at:
		./dev/android-database-sqlcipher/libs
		./dev/android-database-sqlcipher/assets


2. Copy lib files to your android project libs directory
		x86
			libstlport_shared.so
			libsqlcipher_android.so
			libdatabase_sqlcipher.so
		armabi
			libstlport_shared.so
			libsqlcipher_android.so
			libdatabase_sqlcipher.so
		armabiv7
			libstlport_shared.so
			libsqlcipher_android.so
			libdatabase_sqlcipher.so
		sqlcipher.jar
		guava-r09.jar
		commons-codec.jar
		fipswrapper.jar     <----- new as of V1.4.1 -We use this instead of copying fipswrapper.java into source tree!

2a. Copy assets files into your android project assets directory (Don't unzip it!)
		icudt46l.zip

4. In your application, call SQLiteDatabase.LoadLibs(context);
	This will load the JNI libraries
	NOTE: if you fail to do this, when to try to do step 6 you will get a
	linker error.
	

5. In your application,  call your wrapper function
	ex: int result = fipsWrapper.doFIPSmode();
	IF the result = 1 then FIPS mode has successfully been initialized and self
        tests have successfully been run.

        String version = fipsWrapper.doT2FIPSVersion()
        this will get the version (ex: 1.3.0)

6. User sqlcipher database just as you would sqlite
	See: http://sqlcipher.net/sqlcipher-for-android
	
7. When application is complete, create the following FIPS documentation files from templates:
	doc/FIPS140-2ApplicationComplianceStatementTemplate.txt
	doc/FIPS140-2ApplicationComplianceRecordTemplate.txt



=====================================================================
Unit Teests
=====================================================================
The application FcadsTestAndroidApp contains a suite of unit tests that 
test all of the T2Crypto functions .

After running the App the phone display will indicate pass/fail status
and the log will contain detailed information about the tests as well
as pass/fail status.



A note about encryption keys:
------------------------------

When initialized with a passphrase SQLCipher derives the key data using PBKDF2 (OpenSSL’s PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC_SHA1). Each database is initialized with a unique random salt in the first 16 bytes of the file. This salt is used for key derivation and it ensures that even if two databases are created using the same password, they will not have the same encryption key. The default configuration uses 64000 iterations for key derivation (this can be changed at runtime using “PRAGMA kdf_iter”).

The key used to calculate page HMACs is different that the encryption key. It is derived from the encryption key and using PBKDF2 with 2 iterations and a variation of the random database salt. 

If use of a passphrase is undesirable, an application may provide raw binary key data (for instance to support vaulted keys, or the use of PKI based key exchange).
